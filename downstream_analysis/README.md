# Downstream analysis
The script **GenericInOutAnalysisByType.py** fetches all the input and output neurons given a cell type, and sort them by their cell type, if available.

The script **outputFractionAnalysis.py** specifically looks at LPLC1 and their postsynaptic targets, and visualizes how much of LPLC1 outputs are accounted for by connectivity to selected types of downstream targets we studied in the paper.
